# NETFLIX-DATA-ANALYSIS
This project involves analyzing a Netflix movie dataset to uncover insights through data preprocessing and visual exploration. It uses Python (likely with Pandas, Matplotlib, and/or Seaborn) in a Jupyter Notebook format.


**Main Steps in the Project:**

Data Preprocessing:

1-Dataset contains 9827 rows and 9 columns.

2-Cleaned by checking and removing null values and duplicates.

3-Columns such as release_date, vote_average, and genres were formatted or transformed.

4-Unnecessary columns (overview, original_language, poster_url) were dropped.

5-Categorized movies based on vote averages into four categories:
Popular
Average
Below Average
Not Popular
**Data Visualization:**
1-Answered analytical questions using graphs and plots.
2-Genre, popularity, and rating were key focal points.
